      Introduction
Samsidhir Hari Toshnam (SB 1.2.13) which means the perfection is to please Lord Hari and the scriptures Reavled that the easiest way to achieve it is to please Lord’s Devotees. The below are few references
ye me bhakta-janäù pärtha na me bhaktäç ca te janäù |
mad-bhaktänäà ca ye bhaktäs te me bhakta-tamä matäù ||
”[Lord Kåñëa told Arjuna:] ’Those who are My direct devotees are actually not My devotees, but those who are the devotees of My servant are factually My devotees.’ (Adi Purana)
gauräìgera saìgi-gaëe, nitya-siddha kori' mäne,
se jäy brajendra-suta-päç
Anyone who has understood that the associates of Lord Caitanya are eternally liberated souls immediately becomes eligible to enter into the abode of Kåñëa, the son of Nanda Mahäräja in Våndävana.
And in Bhagavad Gita Krishna says whoever knows transcendental nature of his appearance and activities goes to Spiritual world (BG 4.9) and the below verse from Caitanya Bhagavata says something intresting
éçvarera janma-tithi ye-hena pavitra
vaiñëavera sei-mata tithira caritra
Just as the appearance day of the Lord is sanctified, the appearance days of the Vaiñëavas are also.
So by observing appearance and disappearance days of Vaisnavas we can access unlimited mercy of Krishna and Vaisnavas. So here we are attempting to present some of the unlimited Glories, Prayers, Instructions and Teachings of our Acaryas on the occasion of there tithi’s  in order to Please them and also all the vaisnava family.
